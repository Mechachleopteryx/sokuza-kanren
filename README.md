=============

Oleg Kiselyov's minimal implementation of logic programming.

From Oleg's description at http://okmij.org/ftp/Scheme/misc.html#sokuza-kanren :

`This code develops a minimal logic programming system: just enough to get the taste of the concept. The over-arching idea is logic programming being the combination of logic variables and `non-deterministic functions' (that is, `functions' that can return more or fewer than one result). We also make an attempt at the multiple-world semantics of logic programs, and the treatment of logic variables as quantum mechanical quantities, with unification being `the measurement'.
This code is an attempt to distill Kanren to the simplest terms.`
